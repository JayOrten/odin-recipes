    <h2>These are fried balls made of sweetened milk. Think condensed milk bombs!</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 piece cinnamon stick, or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 drops lemon juice, Optional</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh milk</li>
        <li>oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place sugar, cinnamon stick, water and lemon juice in a deep pot or saucepan, and heat over a medium flame. </p> 
            <p>Bring to a boil, and then lower heat until it's at a simmer. Cook until it reaches the thread stage or turns little sticky while stirring occasionally.</p>
            <p>(It will take around 8-10 minutes over medium flame to reach the required consistency.) When the sugar syrup is ready, turn off the flame. Keep warm.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Place milk powder, flour and baking soda in a large bowl. </p> 
            <p>Add oil, and mix well. Sprinkle fresh milk evenly over the mixture and gently mix it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Grease your palms with oil and divide mixture into marble-sized small portions (around 9-10). </p> 
            <p>Take each portion and form solid-looking balls. (Make sure each ball doesn't have any cracks.) Set aside. </p></li>
        <li><p>Heat enough oil for deep frying in a saucepan or pot over medium heat. Slowly drop 3 to 4 balls into the hot oil, and reduce the heat to low.  </p> 
            <p>Deep fry until the balls turn a golden brown, around 6 to 7 minutes. </p>
            <p>Transfer each ball using a slotted spoon to paper towels to absorb excess oil. Repeat with remaining balls. </p></li>
        <li><p>Heat the sugar syrup for 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the milk balls. </p> 
            <p>Keep the balls in the syrup for at least 2 hours before serving so the balls absorb the syrup. (Balls will increase in size as the syrup is absorbed.) Serve at room temperature. </p></li>
    </ol>
